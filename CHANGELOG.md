## [beta-57]
- docker-compose.yaml:
 - teamspeak service is now configured via docker-compose.yaml, no more tsserver.yaml template, also teamspeak_server_setup does not touch any aspect of the teamspeak container
 - removed teamspeak volume
 - the directory teamspeak_server is now bind-mounted into the teamspeak container, licensekey.dat, query_ip_allowlist.txt and query_ip_denylist.txt and logs/ are written to this shared location
- teamspeak-server:
 - packet queue
 - many tiny reworks on internal libraries
 - dockerfile: we create the config.yaml (main teamspeak_server configuration) on the fly now based on docker-compose.yaml environment variables


## [beta-56]

- WARNING: acme folder on the host FS is now used to store the TLS certificates from let's encrypt. You can copy the /mnt/traefik/acme/acme.json to ./acme and afterwards delete the ts-matrix-compose_traefik volume!
- WARNING: docker-compose.yaml sets name to "ts-matrix-compose" now: project name no longer derived from directory name and 
- synapse: fix in teamspeakrules.py for synapse v1.61.0 so that homebase channel creation works again, but but breaks all prior synapse versions (internal TS5SERVER-111)
- teamspeak-server-setup: many UX improvements; coloring + better logging in general; container runs produce logs during initial setup now
- ts-native: automated release build to https://github.com/TeamSpeak-Systems/ts-native/releases for ts-native builds

## [beta-55]

- README.md documentation updates
- ARCHITECTURE.md - updated the SVG image to illustrate the services
- TS-Go based services now use a commong colorlogger based on logrus which brings uniform color logs to our services:
  - events, auth, central_search_feeder, filetransfer
- minio: restart on-failure added
- teamspeak_server: 
  - /help is now publicly readable without an API-TOKEN, see README.md; https://example.com/teamspeak/v1/help

Known issues:

* TS5SERVER-111 - Room creation is not possible on our dev alpha server
* TS5SERVER-89 - Investigate the periodic deletion of files
* TS5SERVER-86 - "illegal base64 data at input byte 8" error on pip ts3 lib usage
